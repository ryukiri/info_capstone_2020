# IKEA UW INFO Capstone 2020
## Overview
We are building a dashboard to display middle-school students' performance data across all homework and exams through the use of Power BI. This web dashboard will provide students a responsive infographic that shows them what they are doing well and how they can improve their school performence. This will allow students to strengthen their weaknesses in school while also exposing them to more data visualizations. By increasing their exposure to data visualizations we hope that this will help improve their data literacy.

## Problem Statement
How might middle schoolers be more comfortable with data by increasing exposure and access so that they can make informed decisions and comfortably utilize data in their lives to answer questions and build future ready skills?
